I HAVE 250 QUESTIONS WRITTEN IN A SET AND I WNAT THAT EACH SDET MUST HAVE 15 QUESTIONA AND SHRE ARE 1 TO 10 TOTAL 15 SETS AND SO HOW CAN I DFO THIS BY CODEING AS AI WNAT 15 QUESTION IN EACH SET

ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍
You’ve got ~250 questions (like the JSON objects you shared), and you want to automatically split them into 15 sets, with each set having 15 questions (Set 1 to Set 15).

That’s a perfect job for a small bit of code. I’ll show you the cleanest and simplest way, and you can use it as-is.

First, the math (quick sanity check)
15 sets × 15 questions = 225 questions

You currently have 250 questions

👉 So 25 questions will be left over.
You can either:

keep them as a reserve set, or

randomly ignore the extra ones, or

create Set 16 later

The code below handles this neatly.

Option 1: JavaScript (best if your data is already JSON)
Step 1: Put all questions in one array
const questions = [
  { q: "What time ______ the plane leave?", options: ["Does", "Do", "Is", "Have"], answer: 0 },
  { q: "The United States ______ a big navy.", options: ["Has", "Have", "Are", "Is"], answer: 0 },
  // ... all 250 questions here
];
Step 2: Shuffle the questions (optional but recommended)
function shuffle(array) {
  for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
  }
  return array;
}

shuffle(questions);
Step 3: Split into 15 sets of 15 questions
const SET_SIZE = 15;
const TOTAL_SETS = 15;

const sets = [];

for (let i = 0; i < TOTAL_SETS; i++) {
  sets.push({
    setNumber: i + 1,
    questions: questions.slice(i * SET_SIZE, (i + 1) * SET_SIZE)
  });
}

console.log(sets);
✅ Result format
[
  {
    setNumber: 1,
    questions: [ {q, options, answer}, ...15 items ]
  },
  {
    setNumber: 2,
    questions: [ ...15 items ]
  },
  ...
]
Option 2: Python (very simple & clean)
import random

questions = [
    {"q": "What time ______ the plane leave?", "options": ["Does", "Do", "Is", "Have"], "answer": 0},
    {"q": "The United States ______ a big navy.", "options": ["Has", "Have", "Are", "Is"], "answer": 0},
    # ... all 250 questions
]

random.shuffle(questions)

SET_SIZE = 15
TOTAL_SETS = 15

sets = []

for i in range(TOTAL_SETS):
    set_questions = questions[i*SET_SIZE:(i+1)*SET_SIZE]
    sets.append({
        "setNumber": i + 1,
        "questions": set_questions
    })

print(sets)
What happens to extra questions?
extra_questions = questions[15*15:]
You can:

save them as backup

or randomly add them later

or make a practice set

Want this next?
I can:

export each set as separate JSON files

generate PDF / Word question papers

auto-number questions per set

create online test format

or randomize sets every time

Just tell me what you want next 😄

GIVE TERMINAL CODE TO PERFORM THIS ACTION 

ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍
Here’s ready-to-run TERMINAL code using Python. You can copy-paste this exactly.

✅ STEP 1: Create a Python file from terminal
nano split_questions.py
(You can also use vi or any editor.)

✅ STEP 2: Paste this FULL code into the file
import json
import random

# ===== LOAD QUESTIONS =====
# Put your 250 questions into questions.json
with open("questions.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    questions = json.load(f)

# ===== SHUFFLE QUESTIONS =====
random.shuffle(questions)

SET_SIZE = 15
TOTAL_SETS = 15

sets = {}

for i in range(TOTAL_SETS):
    set_name = f"Set_{i+1}"
    sets[set_name] = questions[i*SET_SIZE:(i+1)*SET_SIZE]

# ===== SAVE EACH SET AS A FILE =====
for set_name, qs in sets.items():
    with open(f"{set_name}.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        json.dump(qs, f, indent=2)

print("✅ DONE: 15 sets created (15 questions each)")
Save and exit:

CTRL + O → Enter

CTRL + X

✅ STEP 3: Prepare your questions file
Create a file called questions.json

nano questions.json
Paste ALL 250 questions as a single JSON array, like this:

[
  { "q": "What time ______ the plane leave?", "options": ["Does","Do","Is","Have"], "answer": 0 },
  { "q": "The United States ______ a big navy.", "options": ["Has","Have","Are","Is"], "answer": 0 }
]
Save & exit.

✅ STEP 4: Run the script
python split_questions.py
or (if Python 3):

python3 split_questions.py
✅ OUTPUT (AUTOMATIC)
You will get 15 files created in the same folder:

Set_1.json
Set_2.json
Set_3.json
...
Set_15.json
Each file contains exactly 15 questions 🎯

🧠 NOTES
Total used questions = 225

Remaining 25 questions are ignored automatically

Questions are randomized every run

Want upgrades?
I can give terminal code to:

create PDF question papers

export to Excel

generate MCQ test format

auto-number questions

reshuffle sets every time

Just say the word 👌


You said:
CAN I T BE DONE BY TERMAHN 

ChatGPT said:
Yes 👍 it CAN be done directly from the terminal — no editor, no Python file, nothing fancy.

Below are two REAL terminal-only ways. Pick the one you like.

✅ METHOD 1: ONE-LINE TERMINAL COMMAND (Python via terminal)
Assumes:

Your questions are in questions.json

File is a JSON array of 250 question objects

👉 Run this single command in terminal:
python3 - <<'EOF'
import json, random

with open("questions.json") as f:
    q = json.load(f)

random.shuffle(q)

for i in range(15):
    with open(f"Set_{i+1}.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(q[i*15:(i+1)*15], f, indent=2)

print("✅ 15 sets created, each with 15 questions")
EOF
📂 OUTPUT
Set_1.json
Set_2.json
...
Set_15.json
✅ METHOD 2: PURE SHELL + jq (NO PYTHON)
This uses jq (JSON processor).

Install jq (once)
sudo apt install jq        # Ubuntu / Debian
brew install jq            # macOS
Split into sets
jq -c '. | shuffle | .[0:225] | _nwise(15)' questions.json \
| awk '{print > "Set_" NR ".json"}'
⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES
Uses 225 questions

Remaining 25 questions are unused

Every run reshuffles questions

No manual editing required

🔥 BEST OPTION?
Method	Recommended
You have Python	✅ Method 1
You want shell-only	✅ Method 2
If you want:

numbering inside each set

CSV / Excel output

PDF papers

fixed (non-random) sets

Tell me — I’ll give you the exact terminal command for that too 🚀


You said:
INSIDE VS CO0DE \

ChatGPT said:
Ahhh — you mean doing this INSIDE VS Code 👍
Yes, totally doable, and it’s actually the easiest way.

I’ll walk you through it step-by-step, no confusion.

✅ STEP 1: Open folder in VS Code
Open VS Code

Click File → Open Folder

Open the folder that contains questions.json

✅ STEP 2: Open VS Code Terminal
Press Ctrl + ` (backtick)
OR

Menu → Terminal → New Terminal

👉 This terminal is the same as your system terminal, just inside VS Code.

✅ STEP 3: Run this DIRECTLY in VS Code terminal
👉 No file creation needed

python3 - <<'EOF'
import json, random

with open("questions.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    questions = json.load(f)

random.shuffle(questions)

for i in range(15):
    with open(f"Set_{i+1}.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        json.dump(questions[i*15:(i+1)*15], f, indent=2)

print("✅ 15 sets created successfully")
EOF
Press ENTER ✅

✅ STEP 4: Check Explorer (Left Side)
You’ll instantly see:

Set_1.json
Set_2.json
Set_3.json
...
Set_15.json
Each file = 15 questions

🧠 IMPORTANT NOTES
Uses 225 questions

Extra 25 questions ignored

Questions are randomized

Run again → new random sets

⭐ OPTIONAL (Want this?)
I can also help you:

Auto-number questions inside each set

Create PDF question papers

Export to Excel

Lock answers separately

Generate CBT / online exam format

Just tell me what you want next 👌


You said:
I HAVE STORD MY QUESTIONS IN set.json

ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍
That’s no problem at all — just change the filename.

Since your questions are stored in set.json, do this inside VS Code terminal:

✅ RUN THIS IN VS CODE TERMINAL
python3 - <<'EOF'
import json, random

with open("set.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    questions = json.load(f)

random.shuffle(questions)

for i in range(15):
    with open(f"Set_{i+1}.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        json.dump(questions[i*15:(i+1)*15], f, indent=2)

print("✅ DONE: 15 sets created from set.json")
EOF
Press Enter ✅

📂 WHAT YOU’LL SEE
In the VS Code Explorer panel:

Set_1.json
Set_2.json
Set_3.json
...
Set_15.json
Each file contains 15 questions 🎯

🧠 QUICK CHECK
set.json must be a JSON array like:

[
  { "q": "...", "options": [...], "answer": 0 },
  { "q": "...", "options": [...], "answer": 1 }
]
🚀 WANT MORE?
I can:

number questions automatically

separate questions.json & answers.json

export to PDF / Word

shuffle options inside each question

make CBT exam format

Just tell me 👌

this error ocouyr

ChatGPT said:
You’re very close 👍
The error is NOT from the Python code — it’s from set.json format.

❌ WHY THIS ERROR OCCURRED
json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Extra data
This 100% means your set.json is NOT a single valid JSON array.

From what you pasted earlier, your file looks like this 👇

{ "q": "...", "options": [...], "answer": 0 },
{ "q": "...", "options": [...], "answer": 1 },
{ "q": "...", "options": [...], "answer": 2 }
🚫 That is INVALID JSON

JSON must have ONE root element.

✅ CORRECT FORMAT (THIS FIXES EVERYTHING)
Your set.json must look exactly like this:

[
  { "q": "What time ______ the plane leave?", "options": ["Does","Do","Is","Have"], "answer": 0 },
  { "q": "The United States ______ a big navy.", "options": ["Has","Have","Are","Is"], "answer": 0 },
  { "q": "I ______ writing a book.", "options": ["Will","Am","Was","---"], "answer": 1 }
]
✅ KEY RULES
One [[ at the start

One ] at the end

Commas between objects

❌ NO comma after the last object

🛠️ QUICK TERMINAL FIX (NO MANUAL EDITING)
If your file contains many JSON objects separated by commas, run this:

sed '1s/^/[/' set.json | sed '$s/,$/]/' > fixed_set.json
Then use the fixed file 👇

mv fixed_set.json set.json
✅ NOW RUN THIS (WORKING COMMAND)
python3 - <<'EOF'
import json, random

with open("set.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    questions = json.load(f)

random.shuffle(questions)

for i in range(15):
    with open(f"Set_{i+1}.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        json.dump(questions[i*15:(i+1)*15], f, indent=2)

print("✅ DONE: 15 sets created successfully")
EOF
🧪 OPTIONAL: VERIFY JSON BEFORE RUNNING
python3 -m json.tool set.json > /dev/null && echo "JSON OK"
If you see JSON OK, you’re good.

✅ SUMMARY
✔ Error cause: multiple root JSON objects
✔ Fix: wrap everything in [ ]
✔ Code is correct
✔ Your sets will generate perfectly after this

If you want, I can:

auto-fix any bad JSON file

convert your questions to CSV / Excel

validate answers

generate exam-ready PDFs

Just say 👍


You said:
I NEED THE OUTPUT ALSO IN THE SAME A QUESTION IN ONE LINE DONT MAKE IT MULTIILIN E

ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍
You want each question object to be written on ONE SINGLE LINE in the output files — no multi-line formatting.

That’s easy. We just remove indent=2.

✅ RUN THIS IN VS CODE TERMINAL (ONE-LINE JSON OUTPUT)
python3 - <<'EOF'
import json, random

with open("set.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    questions = json.load(f)

random.shuffle(questions)

for i in range(15):
    with open(f"Set_{i+1}.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        json.dump(
            questions[i*15:(i+1)*15],
            f,
            ensure_ascii=False,
            separators=(',', ':')
        )

print("✅ DONE: 15 sets created (one-line questions)")
EOF
📌 WHAT THIS DOES
✔ Each question object stays on one line

✔ No extra spaces or indentation

✔ Output is compact JSON

✔ Still valid JSON

Example output inside Set_1.json
[{"q":"What time ______ the plane leave?","options":["Does","Do","Is","Have"],"answer":0},{"q":"The United States ______ a big navy.","options":["Has","Have","Are","Is"],"answer":0}]
🧠 OPTIONAL (IF YOU WANT EACH QUESTION ON A NEW LINE)
If you want one question per line (still single-line objects):

python3 - <<'EOF'
import json, random

with open("set.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    questions = json.load(f)

random.shuffle(questions)

for i in range(15):
    with open(f"Set_{i+1}.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write("[\n")
        subset = questions[i*15:(i+1)*15]
        for j, q in enumerate(subset):
            line = json.dumps(q, ensure_ascii=False, separators=(',', ':'))
            f.write(line)
            if j < len(subset) - 1:
                f.write(",\n")
        f.write("\n]")

print("✅ DONE: 15 sets created (1 question per line)")
EOF
Output style:
[
{"q":"...","options":[...],"answer":0},
{"q":"...","options":[...],"answer":1}
]
🎯 TELL ME WHICH ONE YOU WANT
1️⃣ Everything compact on one line
2️⃣ One question per line (still single-line objects)

I’ll lock it in exactly how you want 🚀
